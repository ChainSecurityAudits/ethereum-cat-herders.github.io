Welcome to the Ethereum cat Herders' website, the go-to place to get the latest news on upcoming Network Upgrades (Hard Forks), EIP's, announcements and overall core developer and community coordination efforts.

## About
The Ethereum Cat Herders are a group of independent contributors serving the Ethereum community. We are here to support Ethereum developer teams by coordinating Hard Forks, monitoring EIPs, creating PM processes and retroactive reports, relaying information between teams, taking notes during All Core Devs calls and much more.

**Our aim is to bring the minumum amount of order that chaos needs to move Ethereum forward.**

## Upcoming Network Upgrade
On 16 January 2019, a decision was taken to postpone the upgrade of the Ethereum Network, the upgrade named “Constantinople”, scheduled to complete on 17 December 2019.

The next network upgrade "Constantinople 2" is targeted at **27 February 2019**, block number **7.280.000**.
